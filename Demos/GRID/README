To use these screens:

1. Use Canvas's find and replace feature to replace C4P92 with your site name.  
2. The “How to Populate the CygNet Grid.can” screen has a hard-coded service of BSS.  If your Canvas screens are not in that service, then change the string at the top of the script.
3. If desired, change the facilities to match those in your system. If you are using the CygNet for Production sample data, then
this should not be necessary
